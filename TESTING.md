## Code Validation

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide a screenshot for each file you validate.

**PRO TIP**: Always validate the live site pages, not your local code. There could be subtle/hidden differences.

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

- If you are copying/pasting your HTML code, use this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
- (*recommended*) If you are using the live deployed site pages, use this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri

It's recommended to validate the live pages (each of them) using the deployed URL.
This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to a page to validate it again in the future.
The URL will look something like this:

- https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2FAdam-Alive.github.io%2Fcamden-curling-club%2Findex.html

Sample HTML code validation documentation (tables are extremely helpful!):

| Template | Result| Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| base |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-.png) |  |
| index |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-.png) |  |
| booking_list |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-.png) | |
| edit_bookings| | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-.png) |  |
| my_bookings |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-.png) | |
| faq_list |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-.png) | |

| my_pictures |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-.png) | |
| network_list |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html-.png) | |


**IMPORTANT**: Python/Jinja syntax in HTML

Python projects that use Jinja syntax, such as `{% for loops %}`, `{% url 'home' %}`, and `{{ variable|filter }}`
will not validate properly if you're copying/pasting into the HTML validator.

In order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to
[validate by uri](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) from the deployed Heroku pages.

Unfortunately, pages that require a user to be logged-in and authenticated (CRUD functionality),
will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have
access to login to your pages.
In order to properly validate HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select **View Page Source** (usually `CTRL+U` or `âŒ˜+U` on Mac).
- This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
- Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
- Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

- If you are copying/pasting your HTML code, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input
- (*recommended*) If you are using the live deployed site, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri

It's recommended to validate the live site if you only have a single CSS file using the deployed URL.
This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to the page to validate it again in the future.
The URL will look something like this:

- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FAdam-Alive.github.io%2Fcamden-curling-club

If you have multiple CSS files, then individual [validation by input](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
is recommended for the additional CSS files.

**IMPORTANT**: Third-Party tools

If you're using extras like Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, then sometimes the validator
will attempt to also validate this code, even if it's not part of your own actual code.
You are not required to validate the external libraries or frameworks!

Sample CSS code validation documentation (tables are extremely helpful!):

| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FAdam-Alive.github.io%2Fcamden-curling-club) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/css-validation-style.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| checkout.css | n/a | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/css-validation-checkout.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining CSS files |

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

If using modern JavaScript (ES6) methods, then make sure to include the following
line at the very top of every single JavaScript file (this should remain in your files for submission):

/* jshint esversion: 11 */

If you are also including jQuery (`$`), then the updated format will be:

/* jshint esversion: 11, jquery: true */

This allows the JShint validator to recognize modern ES6 methods, such as:
`let`, `const`, `template literals`, `arrow functions (=>)`, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: External resources

Sometimes we'll write JavaScript that imports variables from other files, such as an array of questions
from `questions.js`, which are used within the main `script.js` file elsewhere.
If that's the case, the JShint validation tool doesn't know how to recognize unused variables
that would normally be imported locally in your code.
These warnings are acceptable to showcase on your screenshots.

The same thing applies when using external libraries such as Stripe, Leaflet, Bootstrap, Materialize, etc..
To instantiate these components, we need to use their respective declarator.
Again, the JShint validation tool would flag these as undefined/unused variables.
These warnings are acceptable to showcase on your screenshots.

Sample JS code validation documentation (tables are extremely helpful!):

| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| script.js | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-validation-script.png) | Unused variables from external files |
| questions.js | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-validation-questions.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| quiz.js | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-validation-quiz.png) | Unused variables from external files |
| stripe_elements.js | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/js-validation-stripe.png) | Undefined Stripe variable |
| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining JavaScript files |

### Python

The CI Python Linter can be used two different ways.
- Copy/Paste your Python code directly into the linter.
- As an API, using the "raw" URL appended to the linter URL.
    - To find the "raw" URL, navigate to your file directly on the GitHub repo.
    - On that page, GitHub provides a button on the right called "Raw" that you can click on.
    - From that new page, copy the full URL, and paste it after the CI Python Linter URL (with a `/` separator).
    - Check the example table below for a live demo.

It's recommended to validate each file using the API URL.
This will give you a custom URL which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to a file to validate it again in the future.
Use the steps above to generate your own custom URLs for each Python file.

**IMPORTANT**: `E501 line too long` errors

You must strive to fix any Python lines that are too long ( >80 characters ).
In rare cases where you cannot break the lines [without breaking the functionality],
then by adding `# noqa` to the end of those lines will ignore linting validation.

`# noqa` = **NO Quality Assurance**

**NOTE**: You must include 2 *spaces* before the `#`, and 1 *space* after the `#`.

Do not use `# noqa` all over your project just to clear down validation errors!
This can still cause a project to fail, for failing to fix actual PEP8 validation errors.

Sometimes strings or variables get too long, or long `if` conditional statements.
These are acceptable instances to use the `# noqa`.

When trying to fix "line too long" errors, try to avoid using `/` to split lines.
A better approach would be to use any type of opening bracket, and hit Enter just after that.

Any opening bracket type will work: `(`, `[`, `{`.

By using an opening bracket, Python knows where to appropriately indent the next line of code,
without having to "guess" yourself and attempt to tab to the correct indentation level.

Sample Python code validation documentation below (tables are extremely helpful!).

**Note**: This gives examples of PP3 (Python-only), and Flask/Django files, so eliminate the ones not applicable to your own project.

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

| File | CI URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| run.py | [PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adam-Alive/camden-curling-club/main/run.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/py-validation-run.png) | W291 trailing whitespace |

| Blog views.py | [PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adam-Alive/camden-curling-club/main/blog/views.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/py-validation-blog-views.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| Checkout urls.py | [PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adam-Alive/camden-curling-club/main/checkout/urls.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/py-validation-checkout-urls.png) | W292 no newline at end of file |
| Profiles models.py | [PEP8 CI](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adam-Alive/camden-curling-club/main/profiles/models.py) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/py-validation-profiles-models.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining Python files |


**IMPORTANT**: Django settings.py

The Django settings.py file comes with 4 lines that are quite long, and will throw the `E501 line too long` error.
This is default behavior, but can be fixed by adding `# noqa` to the end of those lines.

Example:

```python
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
]
```

**IMPORTANT**: migration and pycache files

You do not have to ever validate files from the `migrations/` or `pycache/` folders!
Ignore these `.py` files, and validate just the files that you've created or modified.


## Browser Compatibility

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers.

Consider testing AT LEAST 3 different browsers, if available on your system.

You DO NOT need to use all of the browsers below, just pick any 3 (minimum).

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested browsers, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample browser testing documentation:

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Home | About | Contact | etc | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-chrome-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-chrome-about.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-chrome-contact.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browsers/browser-chrome-etc.png) | Works as expected |

| repeat for any other tested browsers | x | x | x | x | x |

## Responsiveness

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

I've tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues.

| Device | Home | About | Contact | etc | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile (DevTools) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/responsive-mobile-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/responsive-mobile-about.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/responsive-mobile-contact.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsiveness/responsive-mobile-etc.png) | Works as expected |

| repeat for any other tested browsers | x | x | x | x | x |

## Lighthouse Audit

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Mobile | Desktop | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-home-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-home-desktop.png) | Some minor warnings |

| Gallery | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-gallery-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/lighthouse-gallery-desktop.png) | Slow response time due to large images |
| x | x | x | repeat for any other tested pages/sizes |

## Defensive Programming

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

MS3 (Flask) | MS4/PP4/PP5 (Django):
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable.
Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website.
Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine,
consider documenting tests on each element of the page
(ie. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their happy flow,
and also the bad/exception flow, mentioning the expected and observed results,
and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

**Defensive programming has been manually tested and the Pass/Fail outcomes summarised below.**

| Page | User Action | Expected Result | Pass/Fail | Comments | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| repeat for all remaining pages | x | x | x | x | x |

## User Story Testing

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

| User Story | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| As a new user, I would like to land on an informative and engaging home page so that I can learn about the club.| ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature01.png) |
|  As a new user, I would like to submit my contact details so that I can register my membership. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature02.png) |
|  As a member, I would like to enter my login details so that I can access the members' area. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature03.png) |
|  As a member, I would like to logout so that I can know my session has been closed securely. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature04.png) |
|  As a member, I would like to submit a question for display on the FAQs page.| ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature05.png) |
|  As a member, I would like to book a practice session so that I can attend at a time that suits me. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature06.png) |
|  As a member, I would like to amend or cancel a practice session so that I can change my plans. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature07.png) |
| As a member, I would like to know if the booking time I want is available so that I can make another choice if necessary. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature08.png) |
|  As a member, I would like to add images to the gallery so that I can share my curling experiences with other members. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature09.png) |
| As a site administrator, I would like to access the administrator panel so that I can manage the club membership and site's pages. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature09.png) |
|  As a site administrator, I would like to know when a new member has registered so that I can email them about their membership options. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature09.png) |

| repeat for all remaining user stories | x |

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

Adjust the code below (file names, etc.) to match your own project files/folders.

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

| App | File | Coverage | Screenshot |

#### Unit Test Issues

Use this section to list any known issues you ran into while writing your unit tests.
Remember to include screenshots (where possible), and a solution to the issue (if known).

This can be used for both "fixed" and "unresolved" issues.

## Bugs

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

- JS Uncaught ReferenceError: `foobar` is undefined/not defined

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug01.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- JS `'let'` or `'const'` or `'template literal syntax'` or `'arrow function syntax (=>)'` is available in ES6 (use `'esversion: 11'`) or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug02.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Python `'ModuleNotFoundError'` when trying to import module from imported package

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug03.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Django `TemplateDoesNotExist` at /appname/path appname/template_name.html

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug04.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Python `E501 line too long` (93 > 79 characters)

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug04.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

### GitHub **Issues**

An improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **Issues** tracker on your GitHub repository.
To access your Issues, click on the "Issues" tab at the top of your repository.
Alternatively, use this link: https://github.com/Adam-Alive/camden-curling-club/issues

If using the Issues tracker for your bug management, you can simplify the documentation process.
Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue without having to first save the screenshot locally,
then uploading into your project.

You can add labels to your issues (`bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s).

Once you've sorted the issue, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following format:

## Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
