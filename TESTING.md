## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all HTML files.

| Template | Result| Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| index (public) | Pass | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html/index-public.png) | Errors due to extension of base.html. |
| index (logged-in) | Pass | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html/index-logged-in.png) | Errors due to extension of base html. |
| booking_list | Pass | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html/booking-list.png) | | Errors due to extension of base.html.|
| edit_bookings|  Pass| ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html/edit-bookings.png) | Errors due to extension of base.html. |
| my_bookings | Pass | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html/my-bookings.png) | Errors due to extension of base.html. |

| network_list |  | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html/network.png) | Errors due to extension of base.html. |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate the CSS file.

- Result: Pass, no errors:

 ![screenshot](documentation/validation/css.png) 

### JavaScript

I have not undertaken any JS validation since the only scripts used in the base.html are imported from reliable sources ie. Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all Python files.

## Browser Compatibility
I've tested my deployed project on Chrome, Edge and Safari to check for compatibility issues.

I tested each browser on the homepage, and then logged in to view each feature. I have provided a summary of these tests below with a screenshot of the homepage or gallery.

| Browser | Home/Gallery | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/screens/chrome.png) | Works as expected |
| Edge | ![screenshot](documentation/screens/edge.png) | Works as expected |
| Safari | ![screenshot](documentation/screens/safari.png) | Works as expected |

## Responsiveness

I deployed the project early on and tested on three of my own devices throughout the development process:

- Moto (g8) power
- HP Desktop (24")
- MacBook Air (13")

I also used Dev Tools to test on a tablet device.

I tested the responsiveness of the homepage and each stage of the game and have provided a summary of these tests below with a screenshot of the home or faqs page.

| Device | Home/Gallery/Faqs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Moto(g8) mobile (own) | ![screenshot](documentation/screens/phone.png) | Works as expected |
| Tablet (DevTools) | ![screenshot](documentation/screens/tablet.png) | Works as expected |
| MacBook Air (own) | ![screenshot](documentation/screens/apple.jpg) | Works as expected |
| HP Desktop (own) | ![screenshot](documentation/screens/hp.jpg) | Works as expected |

## Lighthouse Audit

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application and fully acknowledge that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be required

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `

To create the coverage report, I would then conducted the following:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

| App | File | Coverage | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bag | test_forms.py | 99% | ![screenshot](documentation/tests/py-test-bag-forms.png) |

#### Unit Test Issues

Use this section to list any known issues you ran into while writing your unit tests.
Remember to include screenshots (where possible), and a solution to the issue (if known).

This can be used for both "fixed" and "unresolved" issues.

### GitHub **Issues**

An improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **Issues** tracker on your GitHub repository.
To access your Issues, click on the "Issues" tab at the top of your repository.
Alternatively, use this link: https://github.com/Adam-Alive/camden-curling-club/issues

If using the Issues tracker for your bug management, you can simplify the documentation process.
Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue without having to first save the screenshot locally,
then uploading into your project.

You can add labels to your issues (`bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s).

Once you've sorted the issue, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following format:

**Fixed Bugs**

[![GitHub issue custom search](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-search?query=repo%3AAdam-Alive%2Fcamden-curling-club%20label%3Abug&label=bugs)](https://github.com/Adam-Alive/camden-curling-club/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug)

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://github.com/Adam-Alive/camden-curling-club/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

| [Python `E501 line too long` (93 > 79 characters)](https://github.com/Adam-Alive/camden-curling-club/issues/5) | Open |

## Unfixed Bugs

Some examples:

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
